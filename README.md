Welcome to the repository for the Satellite Tracking and Weather Data Processing System. This project integrates Gpredict, WXtoImg, SDR#, and an Arduino-controlled rotor system to track satellites, receive weather data, and process it into useful information. Below you will find instructions for setting up and using the system.

Overview
The project combines various software and hardware components to achieve satellite tracking and weather data processing. It includes:

Gpredict for real-time satellite tracking and azimuth/elevation data output.
WXtoImg for processing satellite weather data and generating weather images.
SDR# for receiving and demodulating satellite signals using an SDR receiver (e.g., Airspy).
Arduino-controlled rotor system for controlling antenna positioning using two servo motors.
Python script for integrating all components and automating the system.
Components
Hardware:
Arduino Uno
2 servo motors (for azimuth and elevation control)
SDR receiver (e.g., Airspy)
